                            <p class="lead fs-4 text-secondary mb-3">A shipping policy is a set of terms created by an online retailer that describes how orders are shipped to the customer.</p>
                            <p class="mb-5">Shipping policies typically include domestic and international shipping speed options, delivery times, return policies, payment terms, shipping costs, and estimates for order processing time.
                                Shipping policies typically are included in a company’s terms and conditions, or as a standalone document. It is not uncommon to update your policy every few months, especially when you add new shipping carriers.</p>

                                <h2 class="mb-3">What to include in your shipping policy</h2>
                                <p class="mb-5">What you cover in your shipping policy template and how you communicate it will depend on your current business operations and supply chain. The ultimate goal is to be transparent with customers at all times.<br>
                                    As a general rule, your shipping policy should include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Order processing times.</b>After an order is placed, how many business days will it take to get it ready to ship? Communicate if you’re excluding weekends and/or holidays, and if you have certain cutoff times for processing orders (e.g., Orders received after 5pm will be processed the next business day).</li>
                                    <li><b>Domestic and international shipping options.</b>What are the qualifying regions for your domestic shipping options? Which countries have shipping restrictions that you can’t meet? International shipping can be broken down in its own section where you list the countries you ship to and estimated delivery times. If you offer several shipping options like expedited shipping, list them in a table so the information is easy to scan.</li>
                                    <li><b>Shipping costs.</b>Break down your shipping costs for the customer. For example, if you offer free shipping above a certain order total threshold, communicate that in various places as an upsell incentive. Also surface any potential surprise fees, such as import duties and taxes the customer may incur.</li>
                                </ul>
